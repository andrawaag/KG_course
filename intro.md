## Course overview
The term “FAIR Linked Data” refers to a set of best practices for publishing, interlinking and managing structured data on the Web. Semantic Web is an extension of the World Wide Web through recommendations set by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Linked Data practices are implemented with Semantic Web technologies through which computers can query data and enable humans and machines to work in cooperation through a formalised shared meaning. Using knowledge representation formats (such as RDF, RDFS and OWL), ontologies and vocabularies to link data together, inferences can be drawn that show missing links within a given dataset and across datasets. Furthermore, used with Linked Data, SPARQL allows us to query the available information globally. Linked Data technologies enable researchers and industry to share data in ways that are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). As the Web evolves from a web of documents to a Web of Data, Linked Data technologies, such as knowledge graphs, are already broadly in use in industry and research. The first part of the course introduces you to the knowledge, theory, and skills needed to work with Linked Data. We will then focus on research and industrial data applications and needs that are increasingly in demand.

**The learning outcomes are as follows:**
* 
* explain Linked Data principles (Internet, Semantic Web, ontologies, graph databases, schemas), standards and recommendations (as URI, XML, RDF, OWL, SPARQL, ShEx), and their use in forming a Web of Data; 
* use Linked Data technologies for retrieving information in the Semantic Web (i.e. use of SPARQL); 
* use of existing concept spaces (ontologies and controlled vocabularies) for annotating data and endpoints for finding data for a particular domain; 
* understand the FAIR principles and how to apply it to a research project;
* convert research metadata into FAIR Linked Datasets.
